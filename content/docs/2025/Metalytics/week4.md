# **Week #4**

## Testing and QA

- We implemented automated API tests for the backend using pytest and FastAPIâ€™s TestClient.
- The tests cover all main endpoints: root, metals list, historical data, and forecast endpoints.
- Linting is enforced with flake8 to ensure code quality and style consistency.
- Manual QA was performed for the frontend by opening the site in a browser and verifying all UI features and interactions.

### Evidence of test execution

## CI/CD

- We used GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
- The workflow installs dependencies, runs linting (flake8), runs backend tests (pytest), and builds the backend Docker image.
- The workflow also runs the backend Docker container and checks the /health endpoint to ensure the app starts correctly.

Challenges faced:
- We encountered a ModuleNotFoundError for main in tests, which was fixed by setting PYTHONPATH=. in the workflow.
- Docker health checks required a sleep to allow the container to start before testing the endpoint.
